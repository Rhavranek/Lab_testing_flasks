# docs

This directory is exposed to the public web (if you want to) through GitHub pages (enable in your repository settings). It typically is not edited manually but holds rendered versions of all your RMarkdown and jupyter notebooks files. These can be generated from the main directory using the `makefile` via `make docs` (linux/MacOS only).
